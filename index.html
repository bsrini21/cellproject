  <section id="chloroplast">
    <h2>Chloroplast</h2>
    <p>Chloroplasts are responsible for photosynthesis, converting light energy into chemical energy (glucose). They contain chlorophyll, which absorbs light energy and gives plants their green color.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> It has a double membrane, with an inner system of stacked thylakoid membranes called grana. The fluid surrounding the thylakoids is called the stroma.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="vacuole">
    <h2>Vacuole</h2>
    <p>The central vacuole stores water, nutrients, and waste. It helps maintain turgor pressure, which keeps the plant rigid and upright.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> A large, membrane-bound sac filled with fluid, surrounded by a membrane called the tonoplast. The vacuole occupies up to 90% of the volume in plant cells.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="cellwall">
    <h2>Cell Wall</h2>
    <p>The cell wall is a rigid outer layer that provides structural support and protection. It is made of cellulose and helps maintain the plant’s shape. The cell wall also prevents excess water intake.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> It is made primarily of cellulose, a strong carbohydrate fiber that forms a rigid layer outside the plasma membrane.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="membrane">
    <h2>Plasma (Cell) Membrane</h2>
    <p>The plasma membrane controls what enters and exits the cell, maintaining homeostasis.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> It is made of a phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins that allow selective transport of molecules.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="ribosome">
    <h2>Ribosomes</h2>
    <p>Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis, where genetic information is translated into proteins. They can be free in the cytoplasm or attached to the rough ER.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Made of RNA and proteins, ribosomes are either free-floating in the cytoplasm or attached to the rough ER.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="nucleus">
    <h2>Nucleus & Nucleolus</h2>
    <p>The nucleus contains the cell’s genetic material (DNA) and controls cellular functions like growth, metabolism, and reproduction. Inside the nucleus is the nucleolus, which produces ribosomal RNA (rRNA), essential for making ribosomes.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> The nucleus is a large, membrane-bound organelle surrounded by a nuclear envelope with pores. The nucleolus is a dense, spherical structure located inside the nucleus.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="er">
    <h2>Endoplasmic Reticulum (Rough and Smooth)</h2>
    <p>The rough ER has ribosomes attached to it and is responsible for protein synthesis and packaging proteins for export out of the cell. The smooth ER is involved in the synthesis of lipids and the detoxification of chemicals.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> The rough ER is a network of membranous tubules and sacs covered with ribosomes. The smooth ER is a network of tubular membranes without ribosomes on its surface, giving it a smooth appearance.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="golgi">
    <h2>Golgi Apparatus</h2>
    <p>The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids for transport to different parts of the cell or for secretion outside the cell.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> A series of stacked, flattened membrane sacs called cisternae.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="mitochondria">
    <h2>Mitochondria</h2>
    <p>The mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell, where energy (ATP) is produced through cellular respiration. They have a double membrane and their own DNA.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Mitochondria have two membranes: a smooth outer membrane and a highly folded inner membrane called cristae, which increases surface area for energy production.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="peroxisome">
    <h2>Peroxisome</h2>
    <p>Peroxisomes contain enzymes that break down fatty acids and detoxify harmful substances. They also produce hydrogen peroxide, which is then converted into water.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Small, spherical, membrane-bound organelles filled with enzymes such as catalase.</p>
